<pre>
said the senior alter boy to me,
  you are timothy, fearer of god<!-- timotheos? -->
and as i stood there in the sacristy,
steeped in frankincense,
blushing in my crimson cassock,
all the while concealing something sinister under my tongue,
i smile and nod yes i am.

but it is not always an act of timidity to keep your mouth shut.
like the time we stayed up all night,
peeled a lemon like an orange,
ate each segment one by one,
a sacrament to the birth of us,
and did not complain.

or the time we ate a spoonful of cinnamon
and i watched you snort its fiery bark through your nose,
eyes streaming,
anointed us in oil of cassia
while i sat there, steadfast and stony-faced.

but these hands are not afraid to play the forbidden music
the black mass and the white mass,
summon devils or the holy ghost,
or shoo them both away.
why then do you play me <i>pianissimo</i>
when i am clearly marked, <i>con furia</i>, <i>ecstatico</i>, <i>impetuoso</i>?
