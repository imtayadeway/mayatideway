the way he would laugh, the pirate one, *har-harrr*, winking, the more sardonic *hur-hur* and sometimes a *haw-haw* like you stepped into a big old pile of cow shit in only your flip-flops, *schadenfreude*, of uncontrolled hilarity, coming from somewhere deep inside, *HHHAAA HHAA HA hhhaaa hhaa ha*, or a mouthless stifled snorting explosion, the way his brow would furrow up high and his eyes would squint together at the most outrageous part of a story, the way I have only seen him and Albert do it, the way I would do it, only when talking to him and he sees Albert in me, the way he would close one eye and tilt his head when doing his pirate laugh, Robert Newton, the way he would "ruin" photographs with that face or picking his nose, the way he would eventually give you something more authentic that wasn't a smile if you bothered to wait long enough, like the last photo I took of him, the way both of them were pure him, the way he meekly obliged like he just knew, the way he would muss his hair that was wild from bad hair cuts and only washing with soap, Marty, Great Scott, *har-harrr*, the way he would bend his fingers, exercises exercises we must do our exercises, the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain, zee rain in zpain fallz mainly in zee fucking buckets, hm-HM, hm-HM, hm-HM hm-HM hm-HM, the way he would do rasgueados on the table or in the air or finger a passage rhythmically while humming along, ðŸŽµ please release me let me go ðŸŽµ, the way he would raise those big bushy eyebrows and say he was growing them out to comb back and cover his baldness, the way he rolled his eyes and winced whenever Sue talked over him, the way he rolled his eyes and winced whenever Sue spoke for him and got it wrong, the way he rolled his eyes and winced whenever Sue did fucking anything, the way he rolled his eyes and winced whenever Mary did fucking anything, the way he yelled out in pain and looked at me like a hurt little boy when Mary grabbed his arm and pulled it, the same arm she broke and kept pulling until I told her to stop because that wasn't enough by itself, the way he would scarf down his dinner, the human dustbin, the way he would more unapologetically scarf it down and leave the table to go watch television as he got older, the way he was always watching or reading or listening to the news, the time we were looking for a Crombie overcoat in London and saw George Melly and he approached him meekly and George Melly was a complete cunt to him and I was embarrassed and I was never sure if he was too or if he hadn't noticed that George Melly was being a cunt to him, the way he would scratch his five o'clock shadow with his thumbnail and it would make a noise, the way I loved that noise, the way he was not too bad, the way he was every day, in every way, getting better and better, the way how if he was feeling better tomorrow he would get out in the garden or do some work on the bike or work on the train set, the way I think he still thinks that if he's feeling better tomorrow he'll get out in the garden, the way he knew where every single fucking thing in the house was, every screw or cable or piece of rope or catalogue, the way he loved the Blue Moons but was more ambivalent about the Icebergs and how that David Austin was a load of bloody crap, the way he tried to order the roses behind Sue's back on his deathbed, the way he tried to get Lucy in on it because she was sneaky and could keep a secret, the way Sue would give him hell over the least thing but somehow it was worth risking everything for the roses, the way I offered him some Beethoven and he said ooh yeah I'd love a bacon sandwich, the way you hadn't had a bacon sandwich until you had one from that place off London Bridge, the way he was right about that, you hadn't, the way I only really felt myself sometimes when I talked to him, the way I only used my real voice which is a South London voice I suppose when I talked to him and that part of me is also gone forever, the way he wasn't too affectionate but he hugged me at Folkesone Central the last time we were both there and the last two times I saw him in Chester, load of crap, sod 'em, sod the lot of 'em, not too bad, mind how you go, the way he got electrocuted because he liked playing golf most of all when no other fucker would go out, the way he lost himself in golf for two years in Fiji, the way he alluded to existential questions of golf balls and the bleak loneliness of life at sea but was almost always cheerful, the way he only lost his temper a few times ever, the way he was much better at finding golf balls than losing them, the epitome of sartorial elegance, maniacal laughter, *sangfroid*, the way he was wrong about evolution but insisted he was right, the way he had a lot of tall tales, the way he knew the name of every cloud, the way he seemed to relish losing his teeth, *har-harrr, matey*, Speckled Jim, the way he hated Peter Cook for making comedy out of Cerebal Palsy and enjoyed seeing his head being cut off in Blackadder, the way he loved Baldrick, Frank Spencer, Trigger, someone sweet and innocent and kind-hearted who seems to infuriate the others, the way he'd seem to enjoy winding all the other cunts up, the way the world would be much better if we were all Baldricks or Franks or Triggers, the way he thought he had the criminal gene, the way he got me to forge documents for him when I was a kid, the way he took things in lieu of overtime, the way he had exquisite taste but was also an iconoclast, the way he loved his mum until the day she died, the way he loved his mum until the day he died, the way he would have a fry up when the old witch went away, the way he was just a helpless little boy, the way you'd wonder if he'd ever cut his own hair left to his own devices but he didn't like mine much, defenestrate, *teaaaaa, teaaaaaa*, decimate, hanged, successful bowel movement, an exchange of Billingsgate, the way he would have an exchange of Billingsgate with himself, the way you'd always dread his going to sea but he probably quite liked it, *fart easy*, the way this feels like his going to sea for the last time, the big sea in the sky, and the biggest feeling of dread
