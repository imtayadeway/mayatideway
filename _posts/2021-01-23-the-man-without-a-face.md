*. . . . in which i am going with a team of people to gather some mysterious, clear liquid that comes out of the ground . . . there are four of us - sam, myself, a baby and a man without a face . . . sam performs the task while the rest of us gather around . . . the liquid comes from a pipe on the sidewalk, and a nut or lid must be unscrewed in order to get at it . . . sam does this as i advise him on the best way to get this done . . . it comes off and the clear liquid spills slowly out onto the ground . . . sam has brought a glass flask, as if from a chemistry set, and begins to capture some of it . . . while we are waiting the baby plays in a pool of the liquid and we pause to consider if it is safe for them to do so . . . nobody knows the properties of the liquid, which could otherwise be water, that we are collecting . . . .*
