meeting with amy and katya, felt simultaneously imposing and insignificant....i've hated working on this project, it's like when someone leaves their car in a kafkaesque fucking carpark and then expects you to remember where it is upon returning....another heatwave today, stepped out around four after seeing a hummingbird sip from the feeder, the bees were working furiously as if animated by the heat. did i see a hornet too? spiders have put up shop everywhere.
