katya suggested emdr to perhaps get that fucking evil bitch queen and her hellspawn out of my fucking head, which i hadn't even considered, and i don't know if i should even tell dawn about it . . . maybe i have? and got no response. shouldn't it be a big deal if i say it's a big deal. every day, the ambient hate, pointless negotiations . . . or maybe i haven't said anything about it because it's ever-present, too obvious perhaps? still i'm too old and tired to get a new therapist at this point. is this what she's banking on? maybe let's start with the emdr. or the mdma. or why not both?
