when dad died it was like a quiet bomb had been detonated that made
mum take his phone not forty-eight hours after to get it wiped and
swapped out for a free upgrade and made mum gaslight lucy about the
fact that dad had ever given her the epitaph that he wanted and made
up her own with mary and made lucy tell my aunt all the family secrets
and then worry that she had said too much and that she'd tell my other
aunt and that maybe she'd even take legal action against her for
things that happened thirty seven years ago and made lucy worry that
mum and mary were conspiring against her and that dad was really the
only thing that was standing in the way of her becoming destitute and
made mum and mary's actions not entirely inconsistent with that and
made mum ring me not once and when i rang her only spoke about the
fact that the internet was broken and how she wiped his phone less
than forty-eight hours after and how she had already given away some
precious things and did a spring clean of the room and gave ross the
pillows that he died on and made mum decide that dad was a catholic
after all and made mum decide along with mary and matthew that dad
would like to come to his own funeral in jeans because that's how he
felt about mary and matthew's wedding and didn't realize that dad took
enormous pride in his appearance for things that actually mattered and
made mum scold my aunt for being too ill to come but not ill enough to
be dead
