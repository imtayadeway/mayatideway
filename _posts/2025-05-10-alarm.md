sharon stayed with me last night, slept in, woke up late and rushed to the bathroom as soon as i had returned to bed, ostensibly to cuddle, and laid there for too long as their alarm, presumably to tell them they are late for work, began to sound, and it took me back to the time i had stayed up all night with lizzie, retired disappointingly to selena's bedroom, slept for a few hours before, creature of habit, having to get up unreasonably early and, not wishing to just sneak out, hung around in the house for hours, an almost certainly bad decision that intensified when her flatmate's phone, which was in the living room next to me, began to sound its alarm, and i sat paralysed, not knowing what to do, probably not to switch it off, in case it was quite necessary, yet it seemed to continue on for further hours, and if i'd had any sense i would have just run out the door and never looked back, but i didn't because i was already now too invested in the series of bad decisions, i was fully committed and it would only get worse from there, and how it got worse . . . .
