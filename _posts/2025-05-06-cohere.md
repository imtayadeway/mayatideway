slightly better today as i guess the b12 goes to work. still felt like death this morning. trying to write but i'm not sure why. i have nothing in me. i can't even make the words make sense anymore. they don't stick together. not just writing but reading too. i'll make the sounds in my head but the meaning just won't come. what are you supposed to do with that? walked to the nursery at noon again in the full sun, no hat. maybe i wanted to burn a little. had lunch at _por que non?_ with my dalmatian campanula. was a darn sight better company than most. finished flow (2024) in the bath which i suppose is appropriate.
