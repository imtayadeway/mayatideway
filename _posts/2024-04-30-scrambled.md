it is hard to make scrambled egg these days because it reminds me of sitting down as if to breakfast with my dad on the other end of eight time zones away who would routinely comment, ooh that looks nice, what you having, and wishing i could share it with him, knowing he would get nothing like that at home, wouldn't have had a decent breakfast in years
