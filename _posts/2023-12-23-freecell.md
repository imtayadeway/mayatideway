<pre>
if i had a son, and i never will
i would want to impart

to him all of my accumulated experience
from years of playing freecell.

like the time that edie took her last breath
and i played solitaire for 72 hours straight.

they say they made solitaire only to teach
people how to manipulate a pointing device

but it persists now as a means to teach me how to keep
moving when i am all but a dumb terminal

hearts and diamonds on baize
looks just like xmas.
