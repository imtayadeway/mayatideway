<pre>
if i had a son, and i never will, i would want to impart
to him all of my accumulated knowledge from years of playing solitaire.

but i might not start at strategy, an ineffable blend of rubric and intuition
arst arst asrt asrt asrt

i would tell him how in my early years when i got into vegas rules and fantasized
of collecting a hundred dollars at a casino as crowds assembled, awestruck,

how i'd begin to see them when i closed my eyes,
dreamt of searching in the cascade for an impossible card, or maybe death,

how i'd have to up the stakes eventually, yet there is no payoff
in winning, still clicking through to another....

a friend used to joke about playing strip solitaire, and how appropriate
that seems now, having become indistinguishable from internet pornography,

how klondike is also the name of a fictional telephone exchange
that if you dial will take you to 555-fucking-nowhere.

i would tell him about the time that edie played her last card and was xed out
and i lived in a free cell for 2 straight years.

they say they made the computer game only to teach
people how to manipulate a pointing device

but it persists now as a means to teach me how to keep
moving when i am all but a dumb terminal.

hearts and diamonds on baize
looks just like xmas.

when she told me i was playing solitaire to pass the time, the agony of waiting
each phone call escalating in a way i was not ready to understand
describing a course to somewhere i was bound to
but was certain i was not going
