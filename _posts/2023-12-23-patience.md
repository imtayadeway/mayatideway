<pre>
if i had a son, and i never will, i would want to impart
to him all of my accumulated knowledge from years of playing solitaire.

i would tell him how i'd begin to see them when i closed my eyes,
dreamt of searching in the cascade for an impossible card, or maybe death,

i would tell him about the time that edie played drew her last breath and was xed out
and i lived in a free cell for 2 straight years. <!-- where am i hiding in this? -->

how i'd have to up the stakes eventually, yet there is no payoff
in winning, still clicking through to another....

a friend used to joke about playing strip solitaire, and how appropriate
that seems now, having become indistinguishable from internet pornography, <!-- only include this if it supports your thesis. is there a way? -->

klondike is also the name of a fictional telephone exchange
that if you dial will take you to 555-fucking-nowhere.

they say they made the computer game only to teach
people how to manipulate a pointing device

but it persists now as a means to teach me how to keep
moving when i am all but a dumb terminal.

hearts and diamonds on baize
looks just like xmas. <!-- maybe link this somewhere else to the time of year -->

when she told me i was playing solitaire to pass the time, the agony of waiting
each phone call escalating in a way i was not ready to understand
describing a course to somewhere i was bound to
but was certain i was not going
