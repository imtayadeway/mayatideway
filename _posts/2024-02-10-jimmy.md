there was a sort of whisper in the forest, an amalgam of winds that
thrashed this way and that, whistled down corridors, roared in the
canopy, of limbs outstretched, trying to overcome their shyness, of
the transfer of nutrients between intertwined roots, of inosculating
trunks, branches, of fluctuations in the habits of networks of
penetrating mycelia, of the fading and flourishing of mosses and
lichen, of creeks forging new paths, enthused with the surge of
snowmelt in higher altitudes, of the changes in atmospheric pressure,
of the unrelenting certainty of downpours, the influx of positively
charged ions, of the size and weight and frequency and distribution of
rain droplets, of their paths both well-worn and infinitely varied
towards the tender earth, of the subterranean activities of beetles on
the rotting deadwood, of the tendril perversion of vining plants, of
the arboreal locomotion of small animals, of twigs that small birds
assembled here, set up camp, a cornucopia of the remotest extremities
of all the other trees in the area, of the murmuration of swallows, of
birdsong, the cascading patterns of which, undulating, propagating
from tree to tree, of the movements of birds and pollinators rudely
probing us, of the rhythmic pulse of fireflies and the soft persistent
glow of bioluminescent fungi, of the tickling of swordferns, of the
tightening grips of epiphytic plants, of the whirring of twirling
samaras, of the shafts of light softly filtered through leaves,
through the dusty, amber forest haze, of softly dappled light fairies,
that Jimmy, who I had not seen since we were mere saplings really, was
stricken with another infected canker, from which he would this time
most likely not recover, would not have long before being delivered
most finally to the forest floor, and I, forever fixed to this point
now, entertained no hope of seeing my brother again, or any of them
really, no notion of family now save for these memories, save for this
innumerable collection of trees all clinging to this green earth I
suppose, recalling afresh the agony of the first time we were
separated, back in the nursery, my baby brother, a mere sapling, too
young then to join me and Albert and Mary, hearing, when we were
reunited, of the ghastly destruction brought by the storm of '39 to
greenhouse 4B, a terror from which he never fully recovered, would
continue to shake his leaves in a manner, though almost imperceptible,
most unnatural, felt so dead inside for so long, which is funny
because I *am* mostly dead inside, and that dream I always had, the
one where I uprooted myself and could move around freely, where I
seemed to know where Jimmy was and took myself on a little trip over
there, paid him a visit, he made me tea and fried up some eggs, eggs
in a basket, nice little nestegg, and we sat in the little garden that
he tended, talked about mom and dad, which was strange because i knew
that mom took many lovers, in a sense, birds and the bees, but in the
dream
