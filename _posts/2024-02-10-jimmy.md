there was a sort of whisper in the forest, an amalgam of winds that
thrashed this way and that, of limbs outstretched, trying to overcome
their shyness, of the transfer of nutrients between intertwined roots,
of inosculating trunks, branches and roots, of fluctuations in the
habits of networks of penetrating mycelia, of mosses and lichen, of
the tendril perversion of vining plants, of the arboreal locomotion of
small animals, of twigs that the little birds assembled here, set up
camp, a cornucopia of the remotest extremities of all the other trees
in the area, of birdsong, the cascading patterns of which, undulating,
propagating from tree to tree, of the movements of birds and
pollinators rudely probing us, of the shafts of light softly filtered
through leaves, through the dusty, amber forest haze, of softly
dappled light fairies, that Jimmy, who I had not seen since we were
mere saplings really, was stricken with another infected canker, from
which he would this time most likely not recover, would not have long
before being delivered most finally to the forest floor, and I,
forever fixed to this point now, entertained no hope of seeing my
brother again, or any of them really, no notion of family now save for
these memories, save for this innumerable collection of trees all
clinging to this green earth I suppose, recalling afresh the agony of
the first time we were separated, back in the nursery, my baby
brother, a mere sapling, too young then to join me and Albert and
Mary, hearing, when we were reunited, of the ghastly destruction
brought by the storm of '39 to greenhouse 4B, a terror from which he
never fully recovered, would continue to shake his leaves in a manner,
though almost imperceptible, most unnatural, felt so dead inside for
so long, which is funny because I *am* mostly dead inside, and that
dream I always had, the one where I uprooted myself and could move
around freely, where I seemed to know where Jimmy was and took myself
on a little trip over there, paid him a visit, he made me tea and
fried up some eggs, eggs in a basket, nice little nestegg, and we sat
in the little garden that he tended, talked about mom and dad, which
was strange because i knew that mom took many lovers, in a sense,
birds and the bees, but in the dream

as many ways as the samara twirl
 like one of the great apes, where I had sprung from a seed pollinated by the
wind or the bees but from mom and dad's loving embrace
