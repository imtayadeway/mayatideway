there was a sort of whisper in the forest, an amalgam of winds that
thrashed this way and that, of limbs outstretched, trying to overcome
their crown shyness, of the transfer of nutrients between intertwined
roots, of inosculating trunks, branches and roots, of fluctuations in
the habits of networks of penetrating mycelia, of mosses and lichen,
of the tendril perversion of vining plants, of the arboreal locomotion
of small animals, of twigs that the little birds assembled here, set
up camp, a cornucopia of the remotest extremities of all the other
trees in the area, of birdsong, the cascading patterns of which,
undulating, propagating from tree to tree, of the movements of birds
and pollinators rudely probing us, of the shafts of light softly
filtered through leaves, through the dusty forest haze, of softly
dappled light fairies, that Jimmy, who I had not seen since we were
mere saplings really, was stricken with another infected canker, from
which he would this time most likely not recover, would not have long
before being delivered most finally to the forest floor, and I,
forever fixed to this point now, entertained no hope of seeing my
brother again, no notion of family now save for my memories, save for
this innumerable collection of trees all clinging to this green earth
I suppose, recalling afresh the agony of the first time we were
separated, back in the nursery, my baby brother, a mere sapling, too
young then to join me and Albert and Mary, hearing, when we were
reunited, of the ghastly destruction brought by the storm of '39, a
terror from which he never fully recovered, would continue to shake
his leaves in a manner, though almost imperceptible, most unnatural,



recalling too the
recurring dream I had, the one where I uprooted myself and could
move around freely like one of the great apes, where I had sprung from a seed pollinated by the
wind or the bees but from mom and dad's loving embrace

feeling dead inside/i am dead inside
