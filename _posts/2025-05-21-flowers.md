the doorbell rang today and i rushed downstairs to answer. as i opened the door a woman was walking away. hello, i called and, looking down, i noticed the flowers she had left, an arrangement in soft pinks and whites, and wanted to call out, i think there's been some mistake. but she intercepted and when she mentioned my name i realized that this lovely surprise was quite real.
