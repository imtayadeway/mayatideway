i just noticed that dad's rose, the blue moon, is starting to bud out today, after i all but killed it last year. i think it might just make it. his other one, the iceberg, or what i thought was an iceberg, is coming in strong too, so much new growth, and all the buds coated in greenfly, which i suppose is good for the ladybirds or something. one of them is so close to flowering and it's bright pink, which was a bit of a surprise to be honest, because it's supposed to be white and i thought for a second it might be another case of the mystery rose showing up, but they sometimes do that from what i learned, so i'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. blue and white, just like every god damn shirt he ever owned.
