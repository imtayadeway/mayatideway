i want to cry every time i hear the intro to camberwick green . . . not the first bit with the slowly intoned xylophone, but the next part with the sound of the key unwinding and the musical box. i don't know who today would ever think to make such a thing let alone for a child, to make you wait for a full 30 seconds in anticipation while an inanimate object slowly turns on screen. whatever happens next will only disappoint. had my first flute lesson with alison today. nothing was what i expected. find myself stuttering more than usual today but it didn't seem to be a problem during the lesson, which is a good sign. i don't know why my brain seems to get stuck on the easy stuff like . . . what's your name, phone number, would you like a receipt. it's like i panic, because who could even imagine screwing that one up.
