*. . . . in which i am wandering around an outdoor performance space with my bicycle, looking for a place to sit. the options all resemble narrow, diagonally slanted car parking spaces. i am aware of the cumbersomeness of my bike and, as i look around i continue to narrowly miss opportunities as the spaces fill around me. i was too polite to claim the first one. i see ian who announces that sophie is coming with her hair in a bixby roll. and she does . . . before long i find myself on a train to mythical scotland, all out of proportion . . . the line between the map and reality indistinct . . . .*
