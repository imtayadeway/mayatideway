i am...petting george, stroking his big round striped belly, so fluffy as he writhes on the ground, the other cats circling, more aloof, george is the friendly cat, smooshes his face, such a precious moment, craving cats, great comforters, like gretel when grandma died, no cats after gretel followed...a special reationship, understanding, afforded just a few moments here, hoping the girls will take their time, no rush to get to school, i wish someone there would be this friendly with me, why is it just george? why are people so mean and selfish? i guess george wants my love, but that is OK he means no harm what if a kid was like this? new friend...i hope you will be here tomorrow, and the day after, do you know how happy you...
