i am wamdering around an old school building, lookijg for a piano, there used to be one here before. i have tocrawl into this tight soace through this door. i am going round a limg coridor, clockwise. there is a black gentleman who i seem to know. he points to a poster showing different people at different stages of development. he asks me which experiences more pain. suspecting a trick question, i point to the enlightened ones at the top. i am wromg, amd try ti reason about it. he is now gome, iâ€™m outside and looking for him. there is a patch of grass that two women are tending. i understand that it is a garden i started but have not temded. the mint has overgrown, but it is still beautiful. one of hem asks if they may take ownership, amd i encourage them to. i go lookimg foe the package i hve set down. i remember holding the felt from the bottom of a chaor ij my hamds. i  left with rhe image of alan singing to me, just his head, as if i am watching a mysic video, the colors are contrasty, very blue and red, and alan has two mouths, upper and lower. he somgs feom the lower one. he is comveying something spiritual to me, as i listen to the accompaniment, which reminds me now of stairway.
