i am ... waiting, annoyed, trying not to get in the way, bored,
reading the advertisements, wishing i could sit down, on that chair,
that's not for children, wishing she would hurry up, wondering what
they are talking about, what do the adults talk about, women talk
gossip, are you really interested? i'm embarrassed and ashamed, why
aren't you talking to me, you seem like a nice mum and i am a cute and
shy little boy in stupid shoes, i thought women loved me but not so
much lately, mother demands all the attention, can't figure out our
relationship, if our mums know each other, are lindsey and i friends?
i don't think so but i wish you were. i'd like to come over for
bangers and mash, i know where you live, why do all the girls wear the
same dress? your mum's like a bigger you, she is a younger mum, short
just like you, little red nose....
